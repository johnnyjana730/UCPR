## Introduction
We propose UCPR, a user-centric path reasoning network that constantly guides the search from the aspect of user demand and enables explainable recommendations.

## Environment Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.6.5. The required packages are as follows:
* torch == 1.8.0
* numpy == 1.15.4
* scipy == 1.1.0
* sklearn == 0.20.0

## Build Environment(conda)
```
$ cd UCPR
$ conda deactivate
$ conda env create -f requirements.yml
$ conda activate UCPR
```

## Example to Run the Codes

* UCPR
```
$ cd bash
$ bash bash_run.sh $dataset $gpu
```

* `dataset`
  * It specifies the dataset.
  * Here we provide three options, including  * `az`, `mv`, `bu`, `cell`, or `cl`.

* `gpu`
  * It specifies the gpu, e.g. * `0`, `1`, and `2`.
